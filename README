This if the "Filler" process and the owner of the array.
it initializes an array with 100 cells. it loops a 100 times 
getting data through a socket from 3 other processes. if the number 
sent by the process is bigger/equal to the last number in the array it inserts that 
number in the array and send the matching process 1. if the number is not larger/equal 
it send 0. after 100 iterations, whether the array is full or not, it prints the data 
we were asked to show (array size, min value, max value). then it sends -1 to the 
process indicating to finish and printing how many number each process has entered 
to the array.

This is the "prime number creators" program.
when they are ran they create a pipe with the filler process.
when all 3 creators are up and running they receive a signal 
to start drawing random prime number and sending them to the Filler.
if the number the process draws enters the array im the Filler it adds 
one to a counter. after the Filler is finished and sent the signal to the
process here to finish this process prints how much numbers it managed to
insert in the array.

This program is our server that checks for prime numbers. 
it receives a string through the socket and returns a string
that contains only the prime numbers that where in it if there 
were no prime numbers in the string it returns 0

This program is our server that checks for palindrome series.
it receives a string containing a series of number. it checks if the
series is a palindrome and returns to the client through it's socket 1 
if it's a palindrome and 0 otherwise

this is the front end side of our program. it prompts the user to enter a command 'q' or 'p'.
'p': it waits for the user to enter a series of numbers that end with a 0. it puts the numbers
in a string and sends it to the prime server using it's socket after it receives an answer 
from the server it prints it.
'q': it waits for the user to enter a series of number and a 0 at the end of it. 
it puts the numbers in a string and sends it to the palindrome checking server.
the server sends back if the series of number is a palindrome or not.
'e': it quits the program and frees the socket.
